# Analysis and Prediction of the SOFC Parameters by Data-Driven Modeling

This repository contains the source materials and calculation results used in the study ***SOFC Voltage Prediction by Data-Driven Approach***

In this version:
1) added MSE-metric on plot

**Conclusion**:
- full feature set whis default **XGBRandom_Forest** option demonstrated best result for *MAPE* metric
- full feature set whis default **XGBoost** option demonstrated best result for *time*, *R2* and *MSE* metric
- reducing the dimensionality of components gives a negative result and therefore the tools (SHAP, PI, MDI) *do not make sense*
- MLP showed the worst result. MLP+PÐ¡A somewhat speed up the algorithm and increase accuracy, but do not improve the result globally
