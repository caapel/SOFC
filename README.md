# Analysis and Prediction of the SOFC Parameters by Data-Driven Modeling

This repository contains the source materials and calculation results used in the study ***SOFC Voltage Prediction by Data-Driven Approach***

In this version:
1) add 2 variant MultiLayer Preceptron Regressor:
+ MLP default
+ MLP+PCA

**Conclusion**:
- MSE metric is not applicable in the context of this study
- full feature set whis default **XGBRandom_Forest** option demonstrated best result
- reducing the dimensionality of components gives a negative result and therefore the tools (SHAP, PI, MDI) *do not make sense*
- MLP showed the worst result. MLP+PÐ¡A somewhat speed up the algorithm and increase accuracy, but do not improve the result globally
